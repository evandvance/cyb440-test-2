# CYB440 Test 2 Python tool

This tool should be able to do all the requirements to successfully complete
the SPR24 CYB440 Test 2

## Requirements

### Task 1

Create an explination of the advantages/disadvanteges of symmetric encryption

`Explination Here`

### Task 2

Provide an explanation of what bit-level you plan to utilize within your solution
and why it is the recommended NIST level. Provide insite into the minimum recommended bit-levels.

### Task 3

Create a way to create a 256-bit or 32-byte key from a passphrase for encryption. Use the password "cryptogrophy"

### Task 4

Create a way to encrypt and decrypt files to protext confidentiality.

### Task 5

Create a method for the user to create a MAC/HMAC for each file before encryption and after decryption

### Task 6

Create a solution that will allow the users to exchange messages or files but also include a MAC to provide an
extra layer of confidence in the authenticity of the file. Use the password "cryptography"

## How to Use this Code

Clone this repo then run:
